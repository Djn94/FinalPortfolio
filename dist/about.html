                <p>Full-stack capable web developer with a slight preference towards working with front-end technologies
                    and packages such as basic HTML, Javascript, Sass, and Bootstrap. I possess a passion for React,
                    although I am fluent in databases such as MySQL and MongoDB as well as their extensions, Sequelize
                    and Mongoose. I enjoy creating detail-oriented innovative solutions to problems and working
                    methodically to achieve preconceived goals.

                    The 24-week UT Coding boot camp from which I received my certification and 10 years of live
                    performances have given me extreme familiarity with solving complicated problems while withstanding
                    great amounts of stress, completing tasks by required deadlines and efficient time management, and
                    left me no stranger to cohesive teamwork. I am eagerly searching for any opportunity allowing me to
                    expand my knowledge through any languages and to aid whichever team I join with all of the skills I
                    have to offer.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
